<h2 align="center">Image-Compression-with-PCA</h2>
<br>
<h3> 🧐 Introduction</h3>
    This project is focused on using the machine learning technique of principal component analysis(PCA) for image compression. It is an unsupervised leaning algorithm commonly used for dimensionality reduction. It is applied when there are a large number of dimensions in the dataset which poses a problem of overfitting. PCA by itself is a loss less algorithm meaning it wouldn't get rid of the dimensions. Rather it creates new components in dimensions that explains most of the variation.
